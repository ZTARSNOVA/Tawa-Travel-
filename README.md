# ‚úàÔ∏è Tawa Travel | Information System for the Management of School Graduation Trips


Tawa Travel currently manages all processes related to the organization of school graduation trips manually, using physical folders to store documents and notebooks to record data and payments. This methodology often leads to several issues such as loss of information, manual errors in records, and delays in administrative management. The lack of automation not only makes timely data retrieval and correction difficult, but also poses an operational risk. On some occasions, the absence of proper documentation has caused delays, missed flights, or the inability to access scheduled tourist destinations. Additionally, tracking the progress of required documents and payment statuses becomes complex and inefficient.
